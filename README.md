# Prefab Smart Parser

Welcome to the **Prefab Smart Parser** challenge repository! This is the home for the **AI for Prefab** hackathon challenge, where we aim to revolutionize how prefab product data is structured and utilized in the construction industry.

---

## ðŸš€ Challenge Overview

### **Problem**
The construction industry is rich in data but faces a significant challenge: prefab product information is often locked in unstructured formats like PDFs or scattered across web pages. This creates inefficiencies, hinders digital workflows, and limits data-driven decision-making.

### **Solution**
Create an AI-powered tool that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract and structure prefab product data into the **mod-dlm** standard. This open-source, domain-specific language for prefab construction elements will enable seamless integration of prefab components into digital workflows for architects, engineers, and manufacturers.

All solutions will be licensed and stay under the **MIT License**, promoting open collaboration and innovation across the industry.

## About MOD
MOD is an open-source machine-learning powered platform that unlocks the prefab supply chain. We allow architects to do prefab potential checks with price, CO2 impact and delivery time very early in the design phase - 100% model-based and parametric. We give manufacturers access to projects that are now unobtainable.
